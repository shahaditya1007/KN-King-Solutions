# Exercise 2.2

Consider the following program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to");
  printf("fill the time\n");
  printf("available for its completion.\n");
  return O;
}
```
(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.
(b) What output does the program produce?

# Solution
(a)
The directive in this statement is ```# include <stdio.h>``` in line 1. ```printf``` and ```return 0``` are the statements in lines inside the main function.

(b)
The program produces the following output:
```
Parkinson's Law:
Works expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion

```
