# Exercise 2.5

Which of the following are not legal C identifiers?
(a) ```100_bottles```
(b) ```_100_bottles```
(c) ```one hundred bottles```
(d) ```bottles_by_the_hundred_```

# Solution

Identifiers cannot start with digits, hence ```(a) 100_bottles``` is not a legal identifier. Identifiers can only start with letter or underscores
